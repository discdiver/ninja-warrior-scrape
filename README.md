# ninja-warrior-scrape
Scrape American Ninja Warrior (ANW) contestant data over several years, combine the data into a DataFrame, and do some exploratory visual analysis.

Workflow was to develop locally and then use https://hub.mybinder.org/ so matplot lib figures would render. Then download and upload to GitHub. The formatting of the figures is slightly changed, but they render ok.
